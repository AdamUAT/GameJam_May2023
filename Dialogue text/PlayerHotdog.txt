Player x Hot Dog
Look
(It's a hot dog inside a jar. It's staring into your soul.)

Talk
1.
Hotdog: Free me and I'll give you anything you desire.
Player: Whoa! How are you talking?
Hotdog: Am I really? Or is it your mind wanting you to think that I am talking before you?
Player: Listen, I'm not that crazy.
Player: Y'know what, whatever. Can you give me the code to free Catticus over there?
Hotdog: Yes. If you free me.

Uses bat on jar.
2.
Hotdog: I am free at last!
Player: Alright, now can you tell me how to free Catticus then?
Hotdog: For that, my friend you must look to the names of higher life forms.
Hotdog: Perhaps if you use their first letters, you might free Catticus over there.
