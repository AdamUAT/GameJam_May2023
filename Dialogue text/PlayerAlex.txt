Dialogue choice:
Choice 1: Sacrifice Hot Dog
	Alex: Oh? A hot dog, my favorite!
	Player: (You can hear the hot dog's screams of agony.)
	Alex: (As the hot dog's life gets consumed, Alex's mannerisms begin to change as if possessed by another being.)
	Alex: Greetings mortal! You have offered me sufficient sacrifice! For that, I shall reveal to you my true name!
	Alex: Hear me mortal! My name is Gargaloth the Destroyer! While I possess flesh, do not mistake me for a mere mortal!
	Alex: I have lived for millenia and my essence is far greater than any of the ilk that roam this planet!
	Alex: Gargaloth the Destroyer! Remember that name as it'll be the last thing you hear at this universe's end!
	Player: (You walk away slowly.)
	Player: (Let's just pretend like that didn't happen before the existential dread starts creeping up again.)
